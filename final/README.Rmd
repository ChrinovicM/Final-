NOAA Storm Events Analysis (2024) – Comprehensive Data Analytics Project
This repository contains the full workflow, code, documentation, and output for a detailed analysis of the NOAA 2024 Storm Events dataset. The project was completed as part of an academic final assignment, but it is intentionally designed to function as a professional data analytics portfolio piece. It demonstrates real-world data processing, exploratory analysis, visualization, and reproducible reporting techniques using R.

1. Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze severe weather hazards across the United States and answer key questions relevant to emergency preparedness, public health risk assessment, disaster response planning, and seasonal hazard trends. Using the cleaned and merged NOAA dataset, the analysis addresses the following:

1. Which weather event types cause the greatest harm to population health (injuries and fatalities).

2. Which weather event types occur most frequently in each U.S. state.

3. How event frequency varies by month, revealing seasonal patterns.


Additional advanced analyses, including:

Fatality rate per event type

Property damage by event type

States with the highest number of fatal weather events

All results are fully reproducible and implemented with tidyverse-based R workflows.

2. Dataset Description
The dataset originates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and is composed of three related files:

StormEvents_details

StormEvents_locations

StormEvents_fatalities

Each file contains complementary information linked by the shared primary key EVENT_ID.

Key Variables Included
(Descriptions based on NOAA’s official documentation)

EVENT_TYPE: Category of weather event

STATE: U.S. state where the event occurred

BEGIN_DATE_TIME: Start date and time

INJURIES_DIRECT / INDIRECT

DEATHS_DIRECT / INDIRECT

DAMAGE_PROPERTY: Property damage with unit identifiers (e.g., “K”, “M”, “B”)

LAT / LON: Geographic coordinates

LOCATION_NAME: City, county, or zone information

A reference copy of the NOAA Storm Data format is included in this repository.

3. Technical Workflow
Step 1 – Loading and Merging Data
The three raw CSV files were imported and merged using EVENT_ID. The resulting dataset, StormEvents_joined_data.csv, served as the master dataset for all analyses.

Step 2 – Data Cleaning
Cleaning steps included:

Converting date/time fields using the lubridate package

Creating new analytical variables:

TOTAL_INJURIES

TOTAL_DEATHS

TOTAL_HEALTH_HARM

MONTH

Converting property damage values (e.g., “10K”, “3.5M”) into numeric dollar amounts

Normalizing state and event type text fields

Handling missing or malformed data gracefully


Step 3 – Exploratory and Statistical Analysis
Q1. Population Health Impact:
Identified event types with the highest injuries and fatalities. Tornadoes, excessive heat, and flooding consistently demonstrated the greatest total health impact.

Q2. Most Common Event Types by State:
Determined which weather events occur most frequently within each state. Thunderstorm Wind and Hail events dominate across many central and southern states.

Q3. Monthly and Seasonal Trends:
Analyzed how event frequency varies by month. Winter months were dominated by winter storms and ice-related hazards, while spring and summer showed sharp increases in thunderstorm, hail, and tornado activity.

Q4A. Fatality Rate per Event:
Measured how deadly each event type is relative to its frequency. Rare but severe hazards such as rip currents and avalanches showed elevated fatality rates.

Q4B. Property Damage Analysis:
Identified the event types responsible for the greatest economic losses, including Flood, Tornado, Storm Surge/Tide, and Hurricane-related events.

Q4C. States With the Most Fatal Events:
Ranked states based on total deaths and the number of events that resulted in at least one fatality. States such as Texas, Florida, and California tended to have the highest burdens.



Step 4 – Visualization
All visualizations were produced using ggplot2.
A maximum of five figures were included to comply with assignment guidelines.
